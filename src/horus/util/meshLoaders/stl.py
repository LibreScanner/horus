"""
STL file mesh loader.
STL is the most common file format used for 3D printing right now.
STLs come in 2 flavors.
	Binary, which is easy and quick to read.
	Ascii, which is harder to read, as can come with windows, mac and unix style newlines.
	The ascii reader has been designed so it has great compatibility with all kinds of formats or slightly broken exports from tools.

This module also contains a function to save objects as an STL file.
